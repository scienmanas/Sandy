Overall Summary:

The system exhibits a medium risk level (25/100) primarily due to high memory usage. While CPU usage is relatively low, the constant high memory consumption is a significant concern and warrants immediate investigation. The python process running as root with high CPU usage and the processes named cursor could also indicate suspicious activity.

Detailed Analysis:

High Memory Usage: The average memory usage of 91.50% is dangerously high. This can lead to performance degradation and system instability. More importantly, it could mask malicious activity, such as memory-resident malware or processes consuming excessive resources due to exploitation. It requires investigation into why this is high - expected activity or is this unusual.

Root Python Process: The python process (PID 733739) using 16.4% CPU and running as root is suspicious. Python is a versatile language, and its presence running as root could indicate malicious scripts being executed with elevated privileges. While it could be legitimate system administration tasks, it needs to be verified.

User-Specific Processes: The processes called "cursor" running under the user scienmanas consuming memory also warrant investigation. While the CPU usage of these processes is low, multiple instances consuming a significant percentage of memory could be indicators of a malicious user process or application that's been compromised.

Isolated Web Co Process: The "Isolated Web Co" process, while potentially legitimate (depending on its function), should be monitored as processes isolated for web services are often targeted by attackers.

Network Traffic: The network traffic seems reasonable.

Anomalies: The detected anomaly of high memory usage is a critical indicator that needs addressing.

Recommendations:

1. Investigate High Memory Usage: Determine the cause of the high memory usage. Use tools to identify which processes are consuming the most memory and analyze their purpose.
2. Analyze Root Python Process: Identify the purpose and origin of the python script running as root. If it is not a known and trusted script, it should be thoroughly analyzed for malicious activity.
3. Monitor User-Specific Processes: Examine the processes named "cursor". Determine if they are legitimate applications expected to run under the user scienmanas. If not, investigate how they were introduced and their purpose.
4. Review Security Logs: Correlate the system activity data with security logs to identify any suspicious events or patterns. Look for login attempts, file modifications, or other actions that might indicate a compromise.
5. Update and Patch: Ensure the system and all software are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
6. Consider Monitoring Tools: Implement or enhance existing system monitoring tools to provide real-time alerts for unusual activity, such as sudden spikes in CPU or memory usage, unusual network traffic, or suspicious processes.
7. Review user account "scienmanas"

In summary, while the CPU usage is within acceptable limits, the high memory usage and the suspicious python process running as root raise significant security concerns. Immediate investigation and remediation are necessary to mitigate potential risks.
