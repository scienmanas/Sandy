Overall Summary:
The system exhibits a medium risk level with a score of 25/100. The primary concern is high memory usage (91.78%), indicating a potential resource exhaustion issue that could lead to instability or denial-of-service. The high CPU usage by a Python process (PID 730018) running as root is also noteworthy, as it could indicate a malicious script or misconfigured application. The presence of multiple "cursor" processes using significant memory might also warrant further investigation.

Detailed Analysis:

Memory Usage: The high average memory usage is a significant concern. It's crucial to identify the processes consuming the most memory to determine if the usage is legitimate. The processes with the name "cursor" used by user "scienmanas" consumes a reasonable chunk of memory (6.4% + 6% + 2.7%), but it might be specific to a single user. Without further investigation, it's difficult to ascertain whether these processes are benign or malicious.

CPU Usage: The Python process (PID 730018) with high CPU usage (19.6%) and running as root requires immediate investigation. It's unusual for a Python script to consume such a high percentage of CPU, especially when running as root. This process needs to be examined to determine its purpose and whether it's a legitimate application or a malicious script. The "cursor" process with PID 16602 using 3.3% CPU used by "scienmanas" should be examined for any anomalies in its execution.

User Activity: The presence of processes running under the user "scienmanas" is expected, given they're logged in. The processes that runs under this user should be checked periodically.

Network Activity: The network activity is low and not currently a cause for concern. However, this should be monitored continuously, especially in light of the potentially suspicious Python process.

Anomalies: The detected anomaly of high memory usage aligns with the average memory usage statistics and reinforces the need for further investigation.

Recommendations:

1. Investigate the Python process (PID 730018): Determine the purpose of the Python script and its origin. If it's not a legitimate application, terminate the process and remove the script. Analyze the script for any malicious code.
2. Monitor Memory Usage: Identify the processes consuming the most memory and determine if the usage is legitimate. Investigate the "cursor" processes to understand their function and memory requirements.
3. Review Root Privileges: Ensure that only necessary processes are running as root. Minimize the use of root privileges to reduce the risk of a compromised process gaining elevated access.
4. Enhance Monitoring: Implement more detailed system monitoring to track process activity, network connections, and user behavior.
5. Check user activity: Check "scienmanas" for any malicious intent, since it consumes a significant chunk of memory.
6. Update System: Ensure the system is running the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Conclusion:
The system requires immediate attention due to the high memory usage and the potentially suspicious Python process. A thorough investigation and remediation steps are necessary to mitigate the risks and improve the overall security posture.
