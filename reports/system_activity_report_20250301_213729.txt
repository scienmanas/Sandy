Risk Score: 25/100
Risk Level: Medium

Security Assessment:

Overall, the system presents a medium security risk (25/100). While the average CPU usage is low, the high memory usage (91.47%) is a significant concern.

Specific Concerns:

High Memory Usage: The consistently high memory usage suggests potential memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or a process consuming more memory than it should. This could lead to performance degradation or even system instability, and could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service. Further investigation is needed to determine which process(es) are responsible. The absence of any process in the "High Memory Processes" section is unusual and should be investigated as it suggests that memory consumption may be widespread among several processes, none of which stand out individually, or that the reporting mechanism for high memory usage processes is malfunctioning.

Suspicious "cursor" Process: The "cursor" process, with PID 16198 and a high CPU usage of 40.7%, is unusual and needs investigation. It's not a standard system process and may be a malicious program disguised to look less suspicious. The presence of another "cursor" process is also notable.

Python Process Running as Root: The "python" process running as root with a CPU usage of 19.3% is a red flag. Any Python script running with root privileges has the potential to cause significant damage if compromised. The purpose of this script should be immediately identified and its security thoroughly reviewed.

Anomalies:
The anomaly detected, being the high memory usage, supports the overall risk assessment.

Recommendations:

Investigate Memory Usage: Identify the specific processes contributing to the high memory usage and determine the cause. Implement memory management strategies if needed.

Analyze "cursor" Process: Determine the origin and purpose of the "cursor" processes. Scan the related executable file with anti-malware tools. If the process is not legitimate, remove it immediately.

Review Root Python Script: Determine the purpose of the Python script running as root and assess its security. Minimize the use of root privileges where possible. Implement tighter access control to the script.

Monitor System Resources: Implement continuous monitoring of system resources, including CPU, memory, and network activity, to detect anomalies and potential security incidents.

Update System: Ensure the operating system and all software are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Further Analysis:

Further investigation is needed to understand the root cause of the high memory usage and the purpose of the suspicious processes. Detailed process analysis, including file system access, network connections, and associated libraries, is crucial for a more accurate security assessment.
