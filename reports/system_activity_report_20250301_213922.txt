Risk Score: 55/100
Risk Level: High

Security Assessment:

Overall, the system exhibits several indicators of potential security compromise. The risk score of 55/100, classified as "High," is concerning.

High CPU and Memory Usage: The system is experiencing very high CPU (97.43%) and memory (91.84%) utilization. This in itself can degrade performance, but the root cause is of greater concern from a security perspective.

Multiple Python Processes Consuming Excessive CPU: The primary concern is the presence of multiple `python` processes consuming nearly 100% CPU each. This is highly unusual for normal system operation, even if the user "scienmanas" is legitimately running Python scripts. This pattern strongly suggests a resource-intensive malicious activity like cryptocurrency mining, a brute-force attack, or running a botnet.

User Account of Interest: The fact that all these high-CPU Python processes are running under the user account "scienmanas" warrants further investigation. It needs to be determined whether this user's account has been compromised or if they are knowingly running these processes.

Network Activity: While the amount of network data sent and received is relatively low, it's important to consider this in conjunction with the other indicators. The network traffic could be a covert channel used for communication with a command-and-control server.

Anomalies: The detected anomalies of high CPU and high memory reinforce the suspicion of malicious activity.

Recommendations:

1. Immediate Investigation: Prioritize investigating the `python` processes and the "scienmanas" user account. Determine the origin and purpose of these processes.
2. Malware Scan: Run a thorough malware scan using an up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware solution.
3. Network Monitoring: Monitor network traffic for any unusual patterns or connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains.
4. Account Review: Review the "scienmanas" user's account activity for any signs of compromise, such as recent password changes or unusual login locations.
5. Process Isolation: If possible, isolate the affected processes and analyze them in a sandbox environment to determine their exact behavior.
6. System Update: Ensure the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

Conclusion:

The data points to a potentially serious security incident. Immediate action is required to investigate the root cause of the high CPU usage and memory consumption, and to remediate any potential threats. Delaying action could lead to further compromise and data loss.
