Risk Score: 25/100
Risk Level: Medium

AI Assessment:
Security Assessment:

Overall, the system exhibits some concerning security indicators, but further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of the risk. The medium risk score of 25/100 reflects these concerns.

Key Concerns:

High Memory Usage: The average memory usage is very high (87.63%). This could indicate a memory leak, a misconfigured application, or even malicious activity like cryptojacking or data hoarding.

Python Process CPU Usage: A Python process (PID 695607) is consuming a relatively high amount of CPU (19.3%) as root. This is suspicious and needs immediate investigation. Python is often used for scripting and automation, and a root-owned process consuming significant CPU could be running malicious code. We need to check the exact file it is executing, where it came from and its function.

Isolated Web Co Process: The process "Isolated Web Co" consuming 6.4% CPU by user "scienmanas" should be scrutinized, especially because of the vague name. This might indicate a sandboxed web application but it is important to investigate it's origin and purpose.

Anomalies: The detected anomaly of high memory usage needs investigation. This is not necessarily malicious but warrants attention.

Recommendations:

Investigate the Python process (PID 695607): Determine the purpose of the Python script and where it originated. Analyze the script's contents for any suspicious or malicious code. Check cron jobs that run this script.

Investigate Isolated Web Co (PID 76291): Determine what this program is and why is it consuming cpu resources.

Analyze Memory Usage: Identify which processes are contributing the most to the high memory usage beyond the currently listed top processes.

Review System Logs: Examine system logs (e.g., /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/kern.log) for any suspicious activity, errors, or warnings that might be related to the high memory usage or the identified processes.

Update System: Ensure the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Implement Monitoring: Improve system monitoring to provide more detailed information about process activity, network connections, and resource usage.
